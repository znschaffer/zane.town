<h1 id="a-review-of-blogging-software">A Review of Blogging
Software</h1>
<p>Note taking is a source of infinite refactoring for me. My goal has
always been to jot down ideas efficiently, ideally in a
markdown/plaintext format. There are certain niceties you sacrifice with
most plain-text formats though, such as smart linking, tagging, and
general metadata. Neovim can solve parts of these through language
servers and clever plugins, yet the benefits of using a bespoke markdown
editor like obsidian are enticing. This is my vague journey through a
few tools I used to use, and what I thought about them.</p>
<h2 id="obsidian">Obsidian</h2>
<p>I used obsidian for quite a while to organize and compose notes I
needed for my classes. It especially excelled at math, with some helpful
plugins increasing the UX of writing LaTeX and rendering <a
href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">desmos</a> graphs.</p>
<h4 id="syncing">Syncing</h4>
<p>Their paid <em>sync</em> feature rubbed me the wrong way due to the
files being simple markdown, readable and storable by about anything. I
had already set up my vault to live in a Google Drive, yet when trying
to open that vault via the obsidian app, it seemed to be impossible. The
only options are log in to your <em>sync</em> account, or start up a new
vault that lives in iCloud. I‚Äôm not sure if I was just missing something
or if the dark patterns are so heavy that it‚Äôs near impossible to use
your own hosting platform to link iOS and MacOS vaults.</p>
<h4 id="editing">Editing</h4>
<p>Obsidian‚Äôs <em>‚Äúvim mode‚Äù</em>, like so many other editors, is
frustrating. They implement the basics to make you feel comfortable, but
any slightly advanced key combination ends up failing. I‚Äôd rather write
in normal text editor format rather than use a stunted modal editor. I
feel similarly about VSCode‚Äôs vim plugins, although the newer <a
href="">neovim plugin</a> that runs neovim in the background, sending
keystrokes to it and reloading the buffer, seems promising.</p>
<h4 id="publishing">Publishing</h4>
<p>This relates to my frustration with Obsidian‚Äôs syncing - they market
a feature, <em>Vault Hosting</em>, that should be left to the user in
its entirety. I‚Äôm aware of the subjectivity of that statement, but
muddying things up with consumer ways to do basic things doesn‚Äôt seem
good to me. Luckily, unlike the sync problems, you don‚Äôt have to
interface with Obsidians design patterns at all to host your vault. I
chose <a href="">pandoc</a> with a homemade basic stylesheet to make
things look pretty-enough. Adding this workflow to a git commit hook
kept everything simple and easy. Write some notes, commit it, point
github pages to the output directory. The ease of this process is in no
part due to Obsidian or clever design, they chose a ‚Äòfuture-proof‚Äô
markup language to be the basis of their app, letting the user reap all
the benefits of other‚Äôs work in this space.</p>
<h2 id="neovim">Neovim</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm honestly not sure where to start with this, I‚Äôve been using vim
and its newer cousin for so long at this point, that editing with them
and interacting with their oblique UX designs feels like home. I suppose
it‚Äôs unfair to compare ever other editor against it, since the debate
over what vim/neovim <em>really is</em> seems to be never ending.
Whether it‚Äôs a simple text editor or a fully-loaded IDE workstation, the
modal editing features are at the core. Plugin development seems
unmatched, except for maybe VSCode ( but many plugins are ported across
and LSP binaries are universal thanks to the protocol ), patches and new
features are consistently added, and the addition of Lua has seemed to
spur on a lot of intriguing development.</p>
<h4 id="syncing-1">Syncing</h4>
<p>No surprises here! We‚Äôre going to be using markdown files and syncing
them is entirely the users choice ( and responsibility! ). For a while I
went with Google Drive but I‚Äôm back to using git, as the version control
aspect lets me rollback silly mistakes and errors.</p>
